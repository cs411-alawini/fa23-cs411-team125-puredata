## Project Summary

### Project Title: BeatBlendr

BeatBlendr will be a social media app to connect with people based on their music interests.

Based on the user's likes and preferences toward songs we will create a mathematical representation of their music tastes. Using these representations we will recommend other songs, playlists, and users using clustering algorithms and standard distance-based metrics to identify “closeness” between these entities.
