## Project Summary

### Project Title: BeatBlendr

BeatBlendr will be a social media app to connect with people based on their music interests.

Based on the user's likes and preferences toward songs we will create a mathematical representation of their music tastes. Using these representations we will recommend other songs, playlists, and users using clustering algorithms and standard distance-based metrics to identify “closeness” between these entities.

The 2 creative components that we have envisioned that could make our application stand out will be:


#### *Connecting people based on their playlists:*

BeatBlendr will be a social media app to connect with people based on their music interests.

Based on the user's likes and preferences toward songs we will create a mathematical representation of their music tastes. Using these representations we will recommend other songs, playlists, and users using clustering algorithms and standard distance-based metrics to identify “closeness” between these entities.

#### *Crowd-sourcing database by gamification:*

We plan to augment our song dataset by crowdsourcing data with the help of the users of BeatBlendr. New and uncategorized songs will be presented to the users through a mini-game in the application and they will be asked to rate the songs descriptive attributes. Once a certain number of users have rated the song. The song will be added to our dataset. This would not only augment our dataset but also improve the recommendation component and usability of the project.
